## Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **For Raspberry Pi with Pi Camera**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python imgquality.py
```

### Advanced Usage with Configuration
```python
from imgquality import CropFieldQualityAnalyzer

# Initialize with specific crop and weather
analyzer = CropFieldQualityAnalyzer(
    crop_type="wheat", 
    weather_condition="cloudy"
)

# Analyze a frame
analysis = analyzer.analyze_frame_quality(frame)
feedback, priority, adjustments = analyzer.get_drone_position_feedback(analysis)
quality_score = analyzer.calculate_overall_quality_score(analysis)
```

### Configuration File
Edit `config.json` to customize:
- Camera settings

  "quality_score": 85.5,
  "priority": 1,
  "analysis": {
    "brightness": ("Optimal Brightness", 125.3),
    "contrast": ("Good Contrast", 45.2),
    "sharpness": ("Good Sharpness", 120.8),
    "green_coverage": ("Good Crop Coverage", 0.65),

    "noise": ("Low Noise", 3.2)
  },
  "feedback": [
    "Decrease altitude by 0.5-1.0m for better crop detail detection"
  ],
  "recommendations": {
    "priority": 1,
    "actions": [
      {
        "command": "gradual_adjustment",
        "reason": "Moderate quality issues"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Drone Control Commands
- **Priority 0**: Maintain position (optimal quality)
- **Priority 1**: Fine-tune adjustments (minor issues)
- **Priority 2**: Gradual adjustments (moderate issues)
- **Priority 3**: Immediate adjustments (critical issues)

## Integration with Drone Control System

The script generates structured JSON output that can be easily integrated with your drone control system:

1. **Read analysis logs**: Parse JSON files for quality data
2. **Execute commands**: Use generated drone control commands
3. **Monitor quality**: Track quality scores over time
4. **Optimize flight paths**: Use priority system for efficient navigation

## Customization

### Adding New Crop Types
Edit `config.json` to add new crop types:
```json
"new_crop": {
  "green_range": [35, 50, 50, 85, 255, 255],
  "texture_sensitivity": 1.0,
  "detail_importance": "medium",
  "optimal_height": 3.0,
  "min_resolution": 0.5
}
```

### Adjusting Quality Thresholds
Modify thresholds in the configuration file based on your specific requirements and field conditions.

## Performance Optimization

- **Frame skipping**: Adjust `analysis_interval` in config
- **Resolution reduction**: Lower frame resolution for faster processing
- **Selective analysis**: Focus on specific quality metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not detected**: Check camera index in config
2. **Low quality scores**: Adjust thresholds for your specific conditions
3. **High noise levels**: Check camera settings and lighting

### Raspberry Pi Optimization
- Use `picamera` library for better Pi Camera integration
- Adjust frame resolution for performance
- Monitor CPU usage during operation
